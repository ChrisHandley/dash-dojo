Words are useful, but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we build with them.
Similarly, while a lot of powerful, general tools are built into Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in
[libraries]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#library)
that can be called upon when needed.

## Loading data into Python

To begin processing inflammation data, we need to load it into Python.
We can do that using a library called
[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation"), which stands for Numerical Python.
In general, you should use this library when you want to do fancy things with lots of numbers,
especially if you have matrices or arrays. To tell Python that we'd like to start using NumPy,
we need to [import]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#import) it:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it
up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like
a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too
many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we
need for each program.

Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data file for us:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt(fname='combined-no-headers.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[ 0.00000000e+00  6.00000000e+00 -9.00000000e-02 ...  2.02559852e+01

 ...
 [ 3.40000000e+02  2.00000000e+00  3.60000000e-01 ...  8.45799261e+01

   2.43000629e+02  5.00000000e-01]])

{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a
[function call]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function) `loadtxt` which
belongs to the `numpy` library.
This [dotted notation]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#dotted-notation)
is used everywhere in Python: the thing that appears before the dot contains the thing that
appears after.

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.
We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,
just as `loadtxt` is a function that belongs to the `numpy` library.

`numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read and the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#delimiter) that separates values
on a line. These both need to be character strings
(or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#string) for short), so we put them in quotes.

Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,
the [notebook]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#notebook) displays it.
In this case,
that output is the data we just loaded.
By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
Note that, to save space when displaying NumPy arrays, Python does not show us trailing zeros,
so `1.0` becomes `1.`.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file
but didn't save the data in memory.
To do that,
we need to assign the array to a variable. In a similar manner to how we assign a single
value to a variable, we can also assign an array of values to a variable using the same syntax.
Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='combined-no-headers.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data`.
If we want to check that the data have been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 0.00000000e+00  6.00000000e+00 -9.00000000e-02 ...  2.02559852e+01

Now that the data are in memory,
we can manipulate them.
First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
These data correspond to arthritis patients' inflammation.
The rows are the individual patients, and the columns
are their daily inflammation measurements.

{: .callout}

With the following command, we can see the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#shape):

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(343, 23)
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 343 rows and 23 columns. When we
created the variable `data` to store our arthritis data, we did not only create the array; we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same
dotted notation for the attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because
they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix.  Our molecular properties data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 0.0
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[172, 11])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 94.18429025
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[172, 11]` accesses the element at row 172, column 11. While this expression may
not surprise you,
 `data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an MÃ—N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

!["data" is a 3 by 3 numpy array containing row 0: ['A', 'B', 'C'], row 1: ['D', 'E', 'F'], and
row 2: ['G', 'H', 'I']. Starting in the upper left hand corner, data[0, 0] = 'A', data[0, 1] = 'B',
data[0, 2] = 'C', data[1, 0] = 'D', data[1, 1] = 'E', data[1, 2] = 'F', data[2, 0] = 'G',
data[2, 1] = 'H', and data[2, 2] = 'I',
in the bottom right hand corner.](../fig/python-zero-index.svg)

{: .callout}

## Slicing data
An index like `[30, 20]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the first properties (columns) of values
for the first four molecules (rows) like this:

~~~
print(data[0:4, 0:10])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 0.00000000e+00  6.00000000e+00 -9.00000000e-02  0.00000000e+00
   0.00000000e+00 -9.00000000e-02  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00
   0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00]
 [ 1.00000000e+00  2.33333333e+00 -9.00000000e-02  0.00000000e+00
   0.00000000e+00 -9.00000000e-02  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00
   0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00]

   0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 -1.70000000e-01  0.00000000e+00
  -2.70000000e-01  0.00000000e+00]
 [ 3.00000000e+00  9.75000000e+01  7.00000000e-02  0.00000000e+00
   0.00000000e+00 -1.20000000e-01 -1.70000000e-01  0.00000000e+00
  -2.70000000e-01  0.00000000e+00]]
~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#slice) `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to,
but not including, index 4". Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to,
but the rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in
the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

~~~
print(data[5:10, 0:10])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 5.000e+00  9.575e+01  0.000e+00  0.000e+00  0.000e+00  0.000e+00
  -1.700e-01  0.000e+00 -2.700e-01  0.000e+00]
 [ 6.000e+00  9.650e+01 -1.600e-01  0.000e+00  0.000e+00 -1.000e-02
  -1.700e-01  0.000e+00 -2.700e-01  0.000e+00]
 [ 7.000e+00  9.400e+01 -9.000e-02  0.000e+00  0.000e+00 -1.000e-02
  -1.700e-01  0.000e+00 -2.700e-01  0.000e+00]
 [ 8.000e+00  1.250e+00  0.000e+00  0.000e+00  0.000e+00 -1.700e-01
   0.000e+00  0.000e+00 -1.500e-01  0.000e+00]
 [ 9.000e+00  2.250e+00 -9.000e-02  0.000e+00  0.000e+00 -9.000e-02
   0.000e+00  0.000e+00  0.000e+00  1.000e+00]]
~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we don't include the lower
bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the
axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we use ':' on its own), the slice includes
everything:

~~~
small = data[:3, 18:]
print('small is:')
print(small)
~~~
{: .language-python}
The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array.

~~~
small is:
[[  0.           0.          20.25598522 279.4546413    1.        ]
 [  0.           0.          20.25598522 279.4546413    1.        ]
 [ 21.5742147    0.          76.07416785 223.0681843    0.5       ]]
~~~
{: .output}

## Analyzing data

NumPy has several useful functions that take an array as input to perform operations on its values.
If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on
all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

Let's first remove the first column, our data lables which have been interpreted as real numbers

~~~
data = np.delete(data, 0, 1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

And now we can compute the mean

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
53.72029602831553
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#argument).

{: .callout}

Let's use three other NumPy functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum property:', maxval)
print('minimum property:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.max(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.min(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

~~~
maximum property: 646.1013477
minimum property: -0.27
standard deviation: 98.0360663022302

{: .callout}

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at variations in statistical values,
such as the maximum feature per molcule
or the average of a feature across all molecules.
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~
molecule_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis (rows), everything on the second (columns)
print('maximum property for molecule 0:', numpy.max(patient_0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum property for molecule 0: 279.4546413
~~~
{: .output}

Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a
[comment]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comment) that is ignored by Python.
Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other
programmers or their future selves.

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

~~~
print('maximum feature for molecule 2:', numpy.max(data[2, :]))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum feature value for molecule 2: 223.0681843
~~~
{: .output}

What if we need the maximum feature value for each molecule (as in the
next diagram on the left) or the average for each feature over all molecules(as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Per-molecule maximum feature is computed row-wise across all columns using
numpy.max(data, axis=1). Per-features average value is computed column-wise across all rows using
numpy.mean(data, axis=0).](../fig/operation-across-axis.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~

  3.05429392e+02  7.49271137e-01]
~~~
{: .output}

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(22,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(22,)` tells us we have an NÃ—1 vector,
so this is the average for each feature for all patients.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Change In Inflammation
>
> The patient data is _longitudinal_ in the sense that each row represents a
> series of observations relating to one individual.  This means that
> the change in inflammation over time is a meaningful concept.
> Let's find out how to calculate changes in the data contained in an array
> with NumPy.
>
> The `numpy.diff()` function takes an array and returns the differences
> between two successive values. Let's use it to examine the changes
> each day across the first week of patient 3 from our inflammation dataset.
