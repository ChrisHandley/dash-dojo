## Install Python and VS Code

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.

For the IDE of choice, install VS Code, though any like PyCharm, will also work.

## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.
